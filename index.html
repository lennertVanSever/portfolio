        <p>Hi! My name is Lennert Van Sever and my passion is in creating challenging web applications. As a developer I like to do be involved into the full process from User Experience and Interface Design to front and backend development. I don't like to be bound to a certain technology, it really depends on the use case which technologies should be used so finding the right one and learning to apply them is just part of the fun.</p>
        <p>If you don't have much time you can through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennert-van-sever-72783284/">LinkedIn</a>. On this website I go a bit more into detail.</p>

        <h2>Projects I worked on</h2>
        <p>So far I have only worked on a project basis. Most projects took around 6 months up to a year to be developed, although a project is never really finished. Everytime I worked together with a small team of 2 up to 6 great people, keep that in mind since I don't want to take all the credit.</p>
        <h3>Approvals - Borealis Digital Studio</h3>

        <p>Approvals makes it easier to approve or reject items as a manager within <a href="https://www.borealisgroup.com/">Borealis</a>. The purpose is that it becomes so easy that managers approve themself and not delegate it to their assistences.</p>
        <p>For this project I worked as a front-end developer to assure the User Interface, experience and integration was coming together. All the components were custom build, no UI library. It was a lot of fun to get the micro transitions just right. One of the challenges was integrating with SAP and having a better mobile experience through adding Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities. We did the implementation with ReactJS, it was the first time I used React Hooks on a large scale. Approvals is my latest project and it's still under development.</p>
